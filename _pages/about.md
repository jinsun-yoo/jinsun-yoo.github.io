I am a first year PhD student in [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) [School of Computer Science](https://scs.gatech.edu), advised by Drs. [Umakishore Ramachandran](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~rama/) and [Tushar Krishna](https://tusharkrishna.ece.gatech.edu/). I achieved my bachelor's degree in Business Administration in [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/), Korea. Prior to coming to Atlanta, I worked at [MOLOCO](https://moloco.com) as a Software Engineer for 1.5 years.

My current focus is on Edge computing, with a broad interest in distributed systems and hardware architectures. Edge computing opens up the door to a new paradigm of applications. I am excited by the potential impact this will have in our everyday lives, for example in implementing the smart city.

Here is a copy of my [CV](https://jinsun-yoo.github.io/files/resume.pdf). You can reach me at firstname at gatech dot edu
