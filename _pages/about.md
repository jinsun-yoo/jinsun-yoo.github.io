I am a fourth year PhD student in [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu), advised by Drs. [Umakishore Ramachandran](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~rama/) and [Tushar Krishna](https://tusharkrishna.ece.gatech.edu/). I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Business in [Seoul National University(SNU)](https://en.snu.ac.kr/), Korea. Prior to coming to Atlanta, I started my career at [Moloco](https://www.molocoads.com/en/) as a Software Engineer for 1.5 years. During my PhD career I have interned in companies such as Nvidia and Google.

My research focus is on system support for complex and novel applications, spanning across distributed learning and edge computing. For distributed learning, I am looking into better communication optimization strategies, focused on frameworks and the network layer. For edge computing, I am looking into enabling coordinated applicaitions that involve clients that move across city regions. The key is in preemptive data movement and resource allocation across different edge sites, pertaining to client movement. 

Here is a copy of my [CV](https://jinsun-yoo.github.io/files/resume.pdf). You can reach me at firstname at gatech dot edu

At my free time I play the double bass as a proud member of the Emory University Symphony Orchestra([EUSO](https://emorysymphony.org/)).
